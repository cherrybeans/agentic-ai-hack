Coverage Overview (Section 1): The policy provides comprehensive protection specifically designed for motorcycles, scooters, and other two-wheel vehicles, addressing specialized risks for motorcycle riders.\n\n2. Covered Vehicles (Section 2 and 2.1): Coverage applies to a wide range of motorcycle types including street motorcycles (cruisers, sport bikes, touring bikes), scooters and mopeds above 50cc, dirt and off-road bikes, three-wheel motorcycles (trikes), electric motorcycles and e-bikes, as well as vintage and classic motorcycles.\n\n3. Coverage Options and Limits: While the excerpt does not specifically list dollar limits or all options, typical motorcycle policies of this nature include liability coverage (bodily injury and property damage), collision, comprehensive, uninsured motorist protection, and medical payments. Given the comprehensive nature indicated, specialized coverage for theft, custom parts, and roadside services may also be included or available as endorsements.\n\n4. Discounts (from related sections): Safety course completion, safety equipment such as DOT-approved helmets and ABS, multi-policy bundling, and loyalty discounts are noted which can affect premium pricing but do not directly affect coverage limits.\n\nThe exact dollar limits, deductibles, exclusions, and special conditions are not explicitly detailed in the available portion of the motorcycle policy document. Additional documentation or policy schedule pages would be necessary to specify these numeric limits and deductibles.\n\nIn summary, your motorcycle policy includes broad and specialized coverage designed for various types of motorcycles with attention to rider safety and multi-policy benefits, but further documents are needed to provide precise coverage limits, deductibles, and exclusions.\n\nReference: Motorcycle Insurance Policy, Sections 1 and 2 (motorcycle_policy.md)【3:1†motorcycle_policy.md】."}]}], "inputs.tool_definitions": [{"name": "azure_ai_search", "type": "azure_ai_search", "description": "Search an Azure AI Search index for relevant data.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"input": {"type": "string", "description": "Search terms to use."}}}}], "inputs.metrics": {"server-run-duration-in-seconds": 11.0, "client-run-duration-in-seconds": 11.338047742843628, "completion-tokens": 390, "prompt-tokens": 2337, "ground-truth": "The motorcycle policy should include comprehensive coverage, collision coverage, liability coverage, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage options with specific policy limits and deductibles."}, "outputs.operational_metrics.server-run-duration-in-seconds": 11, "outputs.operational_metrics.client-run-duration-in-seconds": 11.3380477428, "outputs.operational_metrics.completion-tokens": 390, "outputs.operational_metrics.prompt-tokens": 2337, "outputs.operational_metrics.ground-truth": "The motorcycle policy should include comprehensive coverage, collision coverage, liability coverage, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage options with specific policy limits and deductibles.", "outputs.tool_call_accuracy.tool_call_accuracy": "not applicable", "outputs.tool_call_accuracy.tool_call_accuracy_result": "not applicable", "outputs.tool_call_accuracy.tool_call_accuracy_threshold": 0.8, "outputs.tool_call_accuracy.tool_call_accuracy_reason": "Tool call accuracy evaluation is not yet supported for the invoked tools.", "outputs.tool_call_accuracy.per_tool_call_details": [], "outputs.intent_resolution.intent_resolution": 4, "outputs.intent_resolution.intent_resolution_result": "pass", "outputs.intent_resolution.intent_resolution_threshold": 3, "outputs.intent_resolution.intent_resolution_reason": "User asked for specific coverage options and limits in the motorcycle insurance policy.

custom vehicle modifications and aftermarket parts is explicitly provided under the section related to \"Custom and Modified Vehicles.\" This section covers professionally modified vehicles, show cars, vehicles with significant aftermarket modifications, and one-off custom builds.\n\nKey Coverage Details:\n- The policy includes agreed value coverage, ensuring pre-agreed vehicle valuation without depreciation.\n- Specialized repair coverage allows for repairs at authorized dealer facilities, using OEM parts or authorized custom fabrication if original parts are unavailable, which supports coverage for custom modifications.\n- There is no depreciation applied to covered items, which typically includes custom parts and modifications.\n- Professional appraisal and annual updates ensure that modifications and custom parts are correctly valued over the policy period.\n\nRelevant exclusions or limits are not specified in the extracted text, but typically, coverage would require that modifications be declared and properly documented as part of the insured vehicle.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Coverage for custom vehicle modifications and aftermarket parts is included.\n- Covers professional modifications, custom fabrication for unavailable parts.\n- Agreed value and repair at authorized facilities with OEM or custom parts.\n- No depreciation on covered custom items.\n- Requires professional appraisal and annual updates.\n\nFor full confirmation of deductibles, specific limitations, or conditions (like requiring prior insurer approval or documentation), please review the policy's full coverage terms or provide the detailed custom parts endorsement section if available.\n\nReference: High-Value Vehicle Insurance Policy, Coverage Features related to Custom and
