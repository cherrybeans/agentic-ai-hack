    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "Policy Number: LIAB-AUTO-001\n",
      "\n",
      "Main important details:\n",
      "- This is a Liability Only Auto Insurance policy providing minimum coverage as required to legally drive.\n",
      "- Coverage includes liability for bodily injury to others and their associated costs (medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, rehabilitation).\n",
      "- Also covers legal defense cost, court judgments, and settlements related to covered claims.\n",
      "- Does NOT cover damages to the insured's own vehicle or medical expenses for injuries to the insured.\n",
      "- Claims must be reported promptly, policyholder is responsible for damages exceeding policy limits.\n",
      "- Policy complies with minimum state liability requirements and does not extend to repair or medical coverage beyond liability.\n",
      "- Section 7.3 emphasizes financial responsibility: no coverage for own vehicle repairs or medical coverage for insured's injuries.\n",
      "- Section 8 clarifies compliance with state laws requiring minimum liability and consequences for non-compliance.\n",
      "- Policy suggests considering umbrella policies for coverage beyond minimum limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy references:\n",
      "- \"This liability-only auto insurance policy provides the minimum required coverage to legally drive in most states. It covers damages and injuries you cause to others but does not cover damage to your own vehicle or injuries to yourself.\" (Section 1)\n",
      "- \"Section 2.1: Bodily Injury Liability - Medical expenses for injured third parties - Lost wages of injured parties - Pain and suffering compensation - Rehabilitation costs for injured parties - Legal defense costs for covered claims - Court-ordered judgments and settlements\"\n",
      "- \"Section 7.3: Financial Responsibility - You are responsible for damages exceeding policy limits - No coverage for your own vehicle repairs - No medical coverage for your injuries - Consider umbrella policy for additional protection\"\n",
      "- \"Section 8.1: State Compliance - Meets minimum state requirements for liability coverage - Proof of insurance required at all times - Penalties for driving without insurance include fines and license suspension\"【3:0†liability_only_policy.md】【3:4†liability_only_policy.md】\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "Based solely on the policy content for LIAB-AUTO-001, the coverage explicitly extends only to bodily injury and liability costs for third parties injured by the insured. It excludes coverage for damage to the insured’s own vehicle or for medical costs to the insured. Therefore, if the claim involves coverage of liabilities to third parties as specified, the claim would be covered under the policy. However, any claims for damage to the insured vehicle or personal injury coverage to the insured would not be covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion:\n",
      "- If the claim aligns with covered liabilities (bodily injury, legal defense, settlements for third parties), coverage is confirmed.\n",
      "- If claim involves own vehicle damage or insured injuries, the claim is not covered.\n",
      "- Policy limits and prompt reporting are critical, and costs exceeding limits remain the insured’s responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the policy provides PARTIAL COVERAGE depending on claim specifics, with coverage strictly limited to third-party liability as outlined.\n",

      "────────────────────────────────────────\n",
      "I have retrieved the claim data for claim ID CL001. The claim involves a vehicle damaged in a parking lot collision on July 17, 2025 with detailed descriptions of the incident, witness, police report, damage, and repair shop estimate. However, I could not find a policy document by the policy number \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" or policy name \"Liability Only Auto Insurance\" in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next step:\n",
      "- Claim Reviewer Agent and Risk Analysis Agent can proceed with detailed analysis based on the claim data.\n",
      "- Policy Checker Agent will not be able to locate the exact policy for coverage verification without the policy document.\n",

      "🤖 ClaimReviewer Analysis:\n",
      "────────────────────────────────────────\n",
      "The insurance claim with ID CL001 has been retrieved and reviewed in detail. It involves a 2004 Honda Accord that sustained significant front-left side damage in a parking lot collision on July 17, 2025. The claim includes thorough documentation: police report, witness statement, photos of the damage, and a detailed repair estimate from a recognized repair shop. The incident description is consistent and corroborated by the attached evidence and witness details. The repair estimates align with typical industry costs for such front-end and side damage, including potential mechanical repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, policy documents for Liability Only Auto Insurance (policy number LIAB-AUTO-001) could not be located in the database to verify coverage terms, limits, or exclusions specifically for this claim. This missing piece critically limits the ability to definitively conclude coverage applicability.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLAIM STATUS: QUESTIONABLE\n",
      "Analysis: The claim is well-documented, with credible evidence supporting the incident and damage extent. Damage assessment and repair costs appear reasonable and justified. The claimant's information and signatures are valid, and the police report number matches the described incident. The main issue is the unavailability of the relevant policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 needed to confirm coverage details, deductibles, and any exclusions such as parking lot incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "- Policy document for LIAB-AUTO-001 not found to validate coverage.\n",
      "- Need confirmation of deductible amount and specific covered damages.\n",
      "- The claim mentions full coverage minus deductible, but deductible value is unknown.\n",
      "- Cross-reference with policy limits and any relevant clauses on coverage in parking lot accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "- Retrieve the actual insurance policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 to verify coverage terms, deductibles, and limits.\n",
      "- Confirm whether parking lot collision damage is covered under the policy.\n",
      "- Validate deductible amount to ensure correct claim payout calculation.\n",
      "- Upon receipt of policy details, finalize coverage determination.\n",
      "- If coverage applies, approve claim subject to policy limits and deductible.\n",
      "- If not covered, communicate denial with clear reasons to claimant.\n",
